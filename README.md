# Biodiversity-in-National-Parks

For this project, you will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

You will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

After you perform your analysis, you will share your findings about the National Park Service.

Project Objectives:
Complete a project to add to your portfolio
Use Jupyter Notebook to communicate findings
Run an analysis on a set of data
Become familiar with data analysis workflow
